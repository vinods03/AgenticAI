Here,  a recruiter or a potential employer can chat with you (your CV actually).
Change the {name} and upload _your_ CV.
What makes this project robust is that, every reply by the agent is evaluated and if evaluation fails, the agent retries to get the correct reply.
This code includes testing of various scenarios .. evaluation fails, retry etc
The final working "chat" function (with all testing code removed) is at the end.
